      "Reasoning: ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT) is a retrieval module that effectively combines the benefits of contextual embeddings with efficient retrieval. One of its standout features is the ability to leverage the strengths of BERT's deep contextual representations while maintaining a highly efficient retrieval process. This is achieved through a two-stage process: first, it indexes documents with their token embeddings and then uses a late interaction mechanism to compute relevance scores during query time. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of queries and documents, leading to improved accuracy in retrieval tasks without incurring the high computational costs typically associated with full BERT inference.\n",
