One of its standout features is the ability to perform late interaction, which allows for fast matching between query vectors and document representations while still leveraging the rich semantic information provided by dense embeddings. This results in improved retrieval performance without significant trade-offs in speed, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \"being destructive to the human species\". Copies and details of the model no longer exist.
