One of the great features of ColBERT is its ability to perform late interaction, allowing for fast and scalable retrieval without the need to exhaustively compare every possible document during the query phase. This means it leverages the power of BERT to generate contextual embeddings for queries and documents while still maintaining efficient performance, ultimately improving both the accuracy and speed of retrieval tasks.\n",
