One of its great features is its use of late interaction between the query and the document representations, which allows for high-quality retrieval while maintaining speed. This method enables ColBERT to achieve high precision and recall by focusing on the most relevant parts of documents, rather than requiring full document comparisons upfront. Additionally, it balances the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, making it suitable for large-scale applications.\n",

One of its great features is its use of late interaction between the query and the document representations, which allows for high-quality retrieval while maintaining speed. This method enables ColBERT to achieve high precision and recall by focusing on the most relevant parts of documents, rather than requiring full document comparisons upfront. Additionally, it balances the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, making it suitable for large-scale applications.\n",

He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \"being destructive to the human species\". Copies and details of the model no longer exist.
